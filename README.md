# 🖼️ Image Classification with MLP and CNN using TensorFlow and Keras 🧠

This project implements and compares two different neural network architectures, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), for image classification. It was originally developed as part of a Machine Learning course 📚.

## Overview 🧐

The goal of this project is to:

* Load and preprocess an image dataset (originally in MATLAB `.mat` format 💾).
* Build and train an MLP model for image classification 🤖.
* Build and train a CNN model for image classification <0xF0><0x9F><0xAA><0xB8>.
* Evaluate the performance of both models on a test dataset 📊.
* Visualize training history (loss and accuracy curves) 📈📉.
* Display sample images along with the models' predictive distributions and final predictions 👀.

## Technologies Used 💻

* **Python**
* **TensorFlow**
* **Keras**
* **NumPy**
* **SciPy**
* **Matplotlib**

## Dataset 📂

The project utilizes an image dataset stored in MATLAB's `.mat` format. The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

* **`train.mat`:** Contains the training images and their corresponding labels 🚂.
* **`test.mat`:** Contains the testing images and their corresponding labels ✅.
